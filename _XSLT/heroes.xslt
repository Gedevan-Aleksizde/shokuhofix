He began to serve Oda Nobunaga as a page boy, and later as his elite soldier. He likes to use a long pike with a crimson shaft. So, he is nicknamed Yari no Mataza, or Mataza the spear, due to his skill and this showy weapon. He is sometimes quite short-tempered. He had been exiled for a few years and was allowed to rejoin Oda's army just a few years ago. He committed a crime to kill a favored servant of Nobunaga who insulted Toshiie.</xsl:attribute></xsl:template>

He is young, but rumored that he is thoughtful and patient. He is also known by several names: Motonobu (元信), Motoyasu (元康), and Ieyasu (家康). In this period, a samurai lord gives one kanji character from his name to his retainer to rename his name. This is often an honor, but also a proof of servitude. After the death of Imagawa Yoshimoto (今川義元), Ieyasu, whose name was Motoyasu at that time, immediately renamed himself Ieyasu.</xsl:attribute></xsl:template>

Although the polygamy system was accepted among the Samurai society at that period, the wives and their children were discriminated against by the mothers' family background.
