They established their seat of power in the Hyūga province as vassals of the Shimazu Clan during the Kamakura period. The current Daimyo, Itō Yoshisuke, came to power after claiming victory against his uncle in a bloody struggle for the leadership of the Clan. Under the uncontested leadership of Yoshisuke, the Itō have expanded their control across the province and drove their former overlords and now bitter rivals from Southern Hyūga. For their independence to not be wasted, the Itō must reach out for allies across Japan, for the inevitable war against the Shimazu which will determine the future of the Itō.">

Flourishing port cities along the coast have introduced Christianity and trade to the Ōtomo lands. As a result of the cultural and technological exchange between the Ōtomo and the Europeans, they have gained an upper hand in Japan's technological arms race, bolstering their ranks with imported matchlock weapons. With land reaching all the way from Bungo in the south, to Hakata in the north, their lands stretch far and wide across Kyushu. However, the Ōtomo are by no means without contention. The Mori clan have invaded from San'yō, taking Moji castle, and threatening the Ōtomo's control of the vital port city of Hakata. With a Mori foothold now digging its fangs into Kyushu, and with the Ryūzōji's rise to power occurring in the west, the Ōtomo must rally under their daimyo, Ōtomo Sōrin, or risk losing the very land and ports that their power rests on.">
