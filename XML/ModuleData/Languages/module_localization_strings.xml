				text="A postbattle location is the result of two armies clashing on the battlefield, leaving dead bodies on the ground. These bodies have armor and weapons that can be worth a fortune, but acquiring these items come at a serious risk. Scavengers will come from all over to plunder and loot the items, and you must compete with others to get as much as you can and get out before you are overwhelmed.{newline}{newline}A post battle can appear when two armies clash and a certain threshold of casualties take place, which is customizable in the options. When entering a post battle, you can select a small number of troops to accompany you. The number of troops you can bring in is dependent on the Roguery skill. Once inside, other looters will be there, collecting the loot of the previous battle. There are several loot piles on the map, which can be interacted with to loot the items. If you press “Alt”, you can see the location of all the loot piles. You can command your troops to loot the piles as well by telling them to do so as a command. Select the formation and left click on the pile you want them to loot.{newline}{newline}Enemy looters are focused on the loot and will only attack the player if they interrupt their looting, or if the player has looted a lot and they want to take it for themselves. These looters are more cowardly than normal troops and will be likely to flee if wounded. The enemy looters will the piles, stealing potential loot from you for themselves, so you must race to get as much loot as possible, or you can attack them for their loot if you’re brave enough. You can also leave them alone, focus on getting as much as you can, and get out by exiting the area and retreating through the red barrier like a normal map. You will keep any loot collected if you retreat this way.{newline}{newline}More enemies will show up over time, equipped with ranged weapons and better armor. They will target the player if the player has loot, so be careful and try not to stay too long or you’ll be overwhelmed."/>

				text="Guns"/>
		<string id="TmU0OGY8"
				text="Guns played a key part in this period of Japanese history. The designs were imported from the west and mass produced in Japan. Known as Tanegashima guns, they were musket-based matchlocks that proved extremely deadly and were able to penetrate Japanese armor with ease. Shokuho has a wide variety of guns, including pistols, muskets, and even an Ozutsu, a small handheld cannon.{newline}{newline}Guns deal high damage, and are highly accurate with the right skills, but are slow to reload. Gunners are vulnerable to cavalry charges, so keep them protected with melee infantry. If you are having trouble dealing with gun troops, try baiting a volley fire from them at a distance, and quickly close the distance with cavalry to disrupt their reloading.{newline}{newline}Gun wielding troops in the first line of a formation will crouch, so the 2nd line in the formation can fire over them. The player may also fire a gun while crouching. Firing a gun while crouching is more accurate. This happens automatically for troops in formation and works even if there are archer troops in the formation as well."/>

To travel around Japan, you will need to acquire boats. Ports are where you buy or build boats. Larger boats will require them to be built, which takes time. You can see boats in production in the Naval Management screen, which can be accessed by pressing H or clicking the icon in the bottom left corner of the screen.{newline}{newline}Once you have enough boats to carry your army, you can go on the water by clicking the “Set Sail” button. If you can’t afford to buy boats, you can also take a ferry, which will take you to a specific port you choose. The ferry will cost more money depending on how many troops you have in your party, and how much your party is carrying. Finally, ports are where you buy or build boats. Larger boats will require them to be built, which takes time. You can see boats in production in the Naval Management screen."/>

				text="Naval Battles"/>
		<string id="WRnHpCFa"
				text="Naval battles are a custom feature unique to Shokuho. It has been designed from scratch to feel like the naval battles of 16th century Japan.{newline}{newline}Naval battles work in custom battles and in the Campaign. For custom battles, boats are chosen automatically based on the number of troops selected for each side. For campaign battles, there is a custom UI to let the player choose which boats they want to select, and which troops go in what specific ship the player selects.All naval battles happen on the open ocean, with each side starting apart from each other. The player can control their ships with simple commands. Each ship has their own formation. The player can tell a ship to move to a specific point by giving the move order command while selecting that ship’s formation. They can also tell ships to charge, causing them to sail towards the nearest enemy ship. If you order a ship to target a specific enemy formation, they will sail towards that specific ship. You can also tell a ship to stop by issuing the stop order. All other movement orders have no function in naval battles.{newline}{newline}You can pilot the ship manually by walking up to the pilot position, near the rear of each ship, and using it. You can steer it by using the movement keys.{newline}{newline}Ships can be sunk and lost. A ship can be sunk by taking too much damage, and almost certainly guaranteeing the death of any crew on board. The most common way of a ship sinking is through collision damage. A ship getting repeatedly collided with will cause a lot of damage, and if a ship takes enough damage, it will begin to sink. Guns can also do a large amount of damage to ships. When a ship starts sinking, it will slowly fill up with water until it is below the surface completely. If one of your ships sinks, even if you win the battle, it will be removed from your list of available ships. Losing a naval battle will also force you to lose all the ships brought into the battle.{newline}{newline}Any agent that falls in the water will drown and die. This is accompanied by a custom drowning animation. This is part of why a sinking ship is so deadly for any troops inside.{newline}{newline}Boarding is the main way to fight in naval battles. Two ships can be boarded when they are near each other, not moving, and facing the same parallel direction. Boarding can happen with ships facing opposite direction, or the same direction. Once boarding begins, the ships will slowing start to align next to each other until they line up, then they will strafe towards each other until they collide. Once this happens, boarding begins, and troops on one boat will begin to board the other. The troops who board are decided by whether the player is issuing the charge command on that formation or not. The player can also board by pressing the use key on the side of the ship that is touching the other ship, which will place them on the other ship. Once all the troops on one side are dead, the troops will head back to their ship and positions and sail out again to find another ship to attack{newline}{newline}{newline}{newline}{newline}{newline}."/>

Overtime you will earn XP and promote to the next unit. You will be given equipment based on your troop, or you can equip your own equipment that you find if you prefer that. When at peace time, your lord may order a mock battle to take place between two sides of the lord’s party. This is a way for you to gain valuable experience without being at war. Once you reach the noble tier of troops (tier 4), you will start receiving tasks from your lord, where you will be asked to leave the party and complete them. Such tasks include scouting enemy settlements, picking up supplies from towns, engaging enemy parties, or when at peace, dealing with looters. Once you reach the max tier of troop and gain enough XP, it will be possible to become a direct vassal of the clan you are enlisted with, even if your renown is lower than normally possible to become a vassal."/>

Thanks to this approach, Shin Buddhism has spread widely among commoners weary of the constant wars between daimyos. In some provinces, leagues of peasant believers, known as ikkō-ikki, have taken up arms to defend their faith and their land, challenging samurai rule."/>
